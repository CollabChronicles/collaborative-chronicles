# collaborative-chronicles
Collaborative Chronicles: A community-driven worldbuilding and storytelling platform where anyone can write to build a shared narrative together. 
# Mission
To provide a platform for anyone to contribute to a collaborative universe shared by everyone online while raising money for charity. 
# How it works
- Users can choose to submit Lore and Story through the "Write!" page on the site
- Lore acts as reference material for this universe. Users must reference at least one piece of existing Lore in order to make a new Story or Lore.
- As a user submits a new Story submission, it is added on the Story page.
- Users are encouraged to donate to charity (1 cent per word for a Story submission and $1 for a Lore submission)
