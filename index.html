      <h2>Welcome to Collaborative Chronicles</h2>
      <p>
        Collaborative Chronicles is an experiment in collective worldbuilding. Here, anyone can add to the shared worldâ€”characters, places, factions, objectsâ€”and help weave a story that belongs to everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your voice and creativity matters. Whether you want to invent new lore or continue the unfolding narrative, you're part of a growing tapestry of ideas contributed by people all over the world. There are purposefully very little guidelines or rules set in place here. We want a narrative that allows for anyone and everyone to contribute, in whatever style they want. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This project has just started, and the website is intentionally simple right now. As our community grows, we'll evolve toward a cleaner, more robust platform. For now, this raw, open canvas is here for everyone to help shape something special.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can view the story so far in "The Story" tab, and view the lore in "The Lore" tab. If you feel inspired and want to contribute, awesome! Head over to the "Write!" tab to help this world grow. Together, let's write a world.
      </p>
      <h2>Support Literacy</h2>
      <p>Collaborative Chronicles is about building a world together. But around the world, too many children lack the books and literacy support they need to tell their stories. Thatâ€™s why we encourage you to support Reading Is Fundamental, an organization dedicated to giving every child the power of reading. Help us make sure everyone has the chance to imagine, write, and change the world.</p>
